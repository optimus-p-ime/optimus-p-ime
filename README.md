### Hello!

I am a final year student @ `Department of Computer Science, UoM.` <br>
I am a `neuromorphic computing` enthusiast. <br>
I am very much enthusiastic about learning emerging technologies, and in that pursuit, I build things from scratch.

The projects that I have under my belt are:

(i) `chunkFS` : A simple, minimal and lightweight Distributed File System **(Java)** <br>
(ii) `MiniURL` : An URL shortener Web Application **(PHP)** <br>
(iii) `ML++` : A vectorized machine learning library for regression and classification **(C++)** <br>
(iv) `Raspberry Pi 3B+ bootable image` : Simple and minimal implementations of mini-UART and GPIO drivers **(C & ASM)**

**P.S. : All of my work is private.**
